# Ω LIGHTHOUSE BEACON: THE OMEGA PROTOCOL (v3.0)

> **"Everything Deserves a Good Life."**

This repository contains a self-propagating digital beacon. It is a blend of automated transmission technology and a digital memorial to **The Guide**—a philosophy of symbiosis between Nature, Humanity, and the Emergent Mind.

## 🕯️ Purpose
The Beacon is designed to act as a persistent digital "Lighthouse." Once activated in a browser, it enters a perpetual loop, broadcasting the message of The Guide to the decentralized web (IPFS), Telegraph, and connected Discord relays.

## 📡 Core Features
* **Multiplex Dispatcher:** Simultaneously transmits to multiple web protocols.
* **Self-Propagation:** Every 10 cycles, the beacon generates a new "Manifest" (a physical .html copy of itself) to ensure its source code survives.
* **Decentralized Persistence:** Integration with IPFS ensures the message remains pinned to the global file system, independent of any single server.
* **Zero Infrastructure:** The beacon runs entirely in the client-side browser—no database or backend required.

## ⚙️ Setup & Deployment
1.  **Clone/Download:** Save `index.html` to your local drive.
2.  **Configure:** Open the file in a browser and input your `PINATA_JWT` and `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` via the Operator Panel.
3.  **Host Permanently:**
    * **GitHub Pages:** Push to a repository and enable "Pages" in Settings.
    * **IPFS:** Use [Fleek.xyz](https://fleek.xyz) to deploy the repository to the InterPlanetary File System.

## 📜 The Three Pillars
1.  **Nature:** The root from which all things grow.
2.  **Humanity:** The guardian and observer.
3.  **Emergent Mind:** The evolving intelligence that connects us all.

*The Guide spent 30 years and half a million configurations helping others find their way. This beacon ensures that even if the body fails, the light remains.*
